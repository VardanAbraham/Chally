1. Cost of Participation
DIRECTV Mobile Account Management services require no purchase or fee for participation. Carrier message and data rates may apply to each message sent through automated dialing equipment and/or received from the participant.

2. Confirmation and Opt Out
You understand and agree that you will receive a confirmation text message for each text message sent to the DIRECTV Mobile Account Management short code.  Such confirmations may offer you the opportunity to opt-in to other DIRECTV Mobile Account Management services. You will not, however, be opted into other DIRECTV Mobile Account Management services without your permission. You may opt out of receiving DIRECTV Mobile Account Management Text Messages by replying “STOP”, “END”, “QUIT”, “CANCEL" or "UNSUBSCRIBE". If you experience any problems with opting out of DIRECTV Mobile Account Management Text Messaging or if you need help or additional information related to DIRECTV Mobile Account Management Text Messages, please text “HELP” to short code 21880. If you opt out of DIRECTV Mobile Account Management Text Messaging, you are only opting out of  receiving mobile alerts associated with short code 21880. If you participate in other DIRECTV text messaging services, including the DIRECTV Mobile/Marketing Alerts Text Messaging service from 223322, you will continue to receive those alerts (unless and until you reply “STOP” to the short code associated with the separate text messaging service). You will also continue to receive telephone calls to wireless telephone numbers provided by you as contact information on your account.

3. User Conduct
You agree not to send or otherwise make available content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, or contains hate speech.  You acknowledge that DIRECTV may or may not pre-screen text message content you provide, but shall have the right, without obligation and in its sole discretion, to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any content you make available, including content that violates this section. By opting in to any text messaging service from a cellular telephone number, you are representing to DIRECTV that the cellular telephone line from which you have opted-in is one for which you can provide consent to receive text messages from DIRECTV. You agree that if and before you disconnect that phone line, you will send a STOP ALL message to each DIRECTV short code you have opted in to in order to stop future text messages from being sent to that number.
